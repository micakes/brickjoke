      <h1>A short joke and some sound.</h1>

      <p>I thought that this would be fun to do and in no way is my professor making me. But while i'm here... I figure that I should tell you a short story. In a field in the middle of nowhere there are two men. One of the two men is big and strong. He is DEFINITELY a weight lifter. His bicep is the size of the other my thigh. I'm talking huge, absolutely built. The second man is teeny tiny and calves the size of my wrist. These two men are completely alone in the field. a completely open field. and in the middle of the field there is a brick. The men decide to engage in a competition. they will see who throws the brick the highest...</p>

<p>... anyways long story short, The big man threw the brick first and it went up and up and up and came plumeting back down 45 full seconds later. Then, the small man threw the brick and it never came down. </p>
